# **App Name**: RoleTailor

## Core Features:

- Guided Role Definition: Interactive Questionnaire: Guide users through a questionnaire to define user roles and their corresponding permissions, utilizing AI to adapt questions based on previous answers to gather necessary info and making sure that critical aspects aren't skipped. The AI component will use the collected information and suggest roles to speed up the process.
- Config File Generation: Configuration File Generation: Use the questionnaire and the input the users entered in the UI as a tool. Generates a configuration file (JSON or YAML) representing the role hierarchy and permissions, based on user inputs from the interactive questionnaire and suggestions. Uses an LLM to intelligently assemble valid output and incorporating data without syntax errors.
- Role Visualization: Role Hierarchy Visualization: Display the defined role hierarchy in a clear and understandable visual format. This enables users to grasp the relationships between roles and their permissions at a glance.
- Permission Control: Permission Management Interface: Offer a user-friendly interface to manage permissions for each role, simplifying the process of adding, modifying, or removing permissions. The user will choose the granularity of the roles, which are stored, processed, and used by the LLM tool.
- Config I/O: Export/Import Configuration: Enable users to export the defined configuration file for use in their projects, as well as import existing configurations to facilitate reuse and sharing.
- Config Validation: Real-time Validation: Provide real-time feedback and validation as users define roles and permissions, ensuring the configuration file remains consistent and valid.
